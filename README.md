# Todo App

This is a simple Todo App created as a solution to the [Todo App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW) challenge from Frontend Mentor. It allows users to add, check off, and filter their todo items. The project was built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

## Learning Points
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the following:

- React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing state and side effects
- Local storage to persist data between browser sessions
- Dynamic rendering and filtering of todo items
- Styling and layout using Tailwind CSS
- Building a responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
